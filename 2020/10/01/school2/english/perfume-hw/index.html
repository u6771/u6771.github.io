<h2 id="Nature-vs-nurture"><a href="#Nature-vs-nurture" class="headerlink" title="Nature vs. nurture"></a>Nature vs. nurture</h2><p><strong>Considering the circumstances of the way Grenoullie was born, was he evil? Or could he have been raised to become a better person? (CH1)</strong></p>
<p>Evilness is traditionally defined to be “the quality of being morally wrong in principle or practice”<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>. However, this is a very vague definition since there does not exist a universal definition of morality. It is a concept that is invented by humans, and its meaning can vary drastically depending on the culture. However, if there are a few things that are agreed to be evil by most cultures, murder is one of them.</p>
<p>I believe the reason serial killers can commit such crimes much easier than the majority can is because of their lack of sympathy. While the majority will choose not to murder because he/she understands that the pain of being seduced to the victim is intolerable to him/herself, or that the loss of a family member is agonizing. “Evil” people will not think that. This is because they have less emotional experience when they grew up. They do not cherish friends and family relationships because they are never granted to them.</p>
<p>In “perfume”, Grenoullie is born in a horrible environment, not only because the fish market in Paris is revolting but also he grows up without a family member. He is not likely to be able to remember his only relative, that is his mother since she is executed only a few days after his birth. He is sent to an orphanage, and soon he sold to a tannery where he has to work hours upon hours a day. They manipulate him as a tool and don’t really have a person to confide to. And when he notices his talent for smelling, that is to him the only supreme meaning of life, naturally, he can make any choices that bring him closer to his goal, including murder.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe Grenoullie’s “evilness” is because of the circumstances of his birth, and that he could have been raised to a better person if he is raised in a better environment.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>How does Suskind use literary and linguistic techniques to characterize Grenouille’s experience?</strong></p>
<p>First, Suskind used diction “drank” and “drowned” to show the immersive and overwhelming experience Grenouille has while he is scenting the aroma. The simile that compares Grenouille to a wooden puppet implies that Grenouille, just as how a puppet is controlled by a person, is controlled by his desire for new scents. The material “wood” is cold and unchanging, which also suggests that Grenouille is emotionally numb and even heartless. Specifically, Grenouille is compared to Pinocchio, who desperately wants to be a real boy instead of a stiff puppet, shows that Grenouille lacks the characteristics of most boys. The phrase “vomited the word up” gives the reader a sense of the suffocating feeling enjoyed by Grenouille while he is processing the intense information of scents Grenouille perceives.</p>
