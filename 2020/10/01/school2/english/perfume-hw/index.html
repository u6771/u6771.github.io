<h2 id="Nature-vs-nurture"><a href="#Nature-vs-nurture" class="headerlink" title="Nature vs. nurture"></a>Nature vs. nurture</h2><p><strong>Considering the circumstances of the way Grenoullie was, was he born evil? Or could he have been raised to become a better person? (CH1)</strong></p>
<p>Evilness is traditionally defined to be “the quality of being morally wrong in principle or practice”<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup>. However, this is a very vague definition since there does not exist a universal definition of morality in the first place. It is simply a concept that is invented by humans, and its meaning can vary drastically depending on the culture. However, if there are a few things that are agreed to be evil by most cultures, murder is one of them.</p>
<p>I believe the reason why serial killers can commit such crimes much easier than the majority can is because of their lack of sympathy. While the majority will choose not to murder because he/she understands that the pain of being seduced to the victim is intolerable to him/herself, or that the loss of a family member is agonizing. “Evil” people will not think that. This is because they have a less emotional experience when they grew up. They do not cherish friends and family relationships because they are never granted to them.</p>
<p>In “perfume”, Grenoullie is born in a horrible environment, not only because the fish market in Paris is physically revolting, but also he grows up without a family member. He is not likely to be able to remember his only relative, that is his mother since she is executed only a few days after his birth. He is sent to an orphanage, and soon he sold to a tannery where he has to work hours upon hours a day. He is manipulated as a tool and doesn’t really have a person to confide to. And when he notices his talent for smelling, that is to him the only supreme meaning of life, naturally, he is able to make any choices that bring him closer to his goal, including murder.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I do believe Grenoullie’s “evilness” is due to the circumstances of his birth, and that he could have been raised to a better person if he is raised in a better environment.</p>
